# Arc - Visual Architecture Diagram Library

Arc is a React component library for rendering beautiful, interactive architecture diagrams. It provides a declarative JSON format for defining diagrams and multiple built-in themes.

## Why Arc?

Architecture diagrams typically live in design tools, disconnected from the code they describe. Arc keeps diagrams as declarative configs that:

- **Version with your code** - Diffs show exactly what changed
- **Render anywhere** - Use the lightweight player or export to SVG/PNG
- **Stay consistent** - Templates enforce color palettes and sizing rules

## Packages

| Package | Size | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| `@arach/arc` | ~75KB | Full editor + player components |
| `@arach/arc-player` | ~7KB | Lightweight renderer only |

## Key Features

- **Visual Editor** - Drag-and-drop nodes, connectors, groups, and images
- **Declarative Exports** - JSON/TypeScript configs designed for version control
- **Templates** - Built-in themes and sizing presets
- **Isometric View** - Toggle 3D projection for visual impact
- **Multiple Export Formats** - JSON, TypeScript, SVG, PNG, clipboard embed
