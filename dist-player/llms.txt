# Arc (LLM Guide)

Arc is a visual editor for building architecture diagrams that stay in code. The editor outputs a
clean, declarative model (JSON/TypeScript) that can be committed, diffed, and reused in docs.

Quickstart (bun):
- bun install
- bun run dev
- bun run build
- bun run lint
- bun run typecheck

Key entry points:
- src/App.tsx (landing vs editor via hash; #editor opens the editor)
- src/main.tsx (React entry)
- src/landing.css (landing page styles)

Editor architecture:
- src/components/editor/ (canvas, panels, toolbar, reducer)
- src/components/editor/editorReducer.ts (state + history)
- src/components/properties/ (editing forms)
- src/utils/ (diagram helpers, templates, export utilities, file operations)

Landing page diagrams:
- src/components/ArcDiagram.tsx (Talkie-style diagram renderer)
- src/components/diagrams/architecture.diagram.ts (Arc diagram data)
- src/components/ArcArchitectureNext.tsx (complementary blueprint diagram)

Docs (Markdown):
- docs/intro.md (intro + quickstart)
- docs/architecture.md (architecture overview)
- public/docs/ (same docs for GitHub Pages)

Diagram model shape:
- layout, nodes, nodeData, connectors, connectorStyles
- See docs/architecture.md for examples.
